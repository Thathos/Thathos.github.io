    <h3>Hello! Im Reggie!</h3>
    This is the final project of our CIS 130 course at OTC. I am a computer science major taking a second attempt at college after taking some time off. I have taken quite a few classes at OTC as I have changed my major once before. The classes that I have taken include Technology and Digital Literacy, Biology, Composition, and more. Classes I intend to take in the future include Website Development 2, the Software Engineering project, Physics, Algebra, and a more.

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>My only experience with anything related to computer science outside of the program is a learning a small amount of html and how it works in building webistes. My work experience only includes retail work, but with my interest in Technology allows me to help people with mostly basic technology inquiries.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>As for things I enjoy in my free time, I like to relax with friends and family. I love watching sports, specifically Soccer, Football, and Basketball. I recently fell in love with weightlifting as a means to take care of myself physically.</p>

    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>My goal is to land a good job doing something with technology. As the industry is always expanding with new toys there is almost always something exciting to look forward to.</p>
