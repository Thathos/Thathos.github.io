    <h2>Hello! Im Reggie!</h2>
    <p>This is the final project of our CIS 130 course at OTC. I am a computer science major taking a second attempt at college after taking some time off. I have taken quite a few classes at OTC as I have changed my major once before. As it is a techincal college, 
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Classes Taken</th>
            <th>Future Classes to take</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Composition</td>
            <td>Software Engineering Project</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>College Algebra</td>
            <td>Databases and data structures</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Technology and Digital Literacy</td>
            <td>Physics</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        I have taken the general prerequesites that are required such as math, history, public speaking and composition. As for courses taken specifically for my major I have taken, Technology and Digital Literacy, and Prob solving and prog concepts. Classes that I plan to take include the software engineering project, databases and data structures and a physics course, along with a couple others.
        As someone who is working part time while going to school my graduation date is around 2 years from now.</p>
    
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>My only experience with anything related to computer science outside of the program is a learning a small amount of html and how it works in building webistes. My work experience only includes retail work, but with my interest in Technology allows me to help people with mostly basic tech questions.  </p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>As for things I enjoy in my free time, I like to relax with friends and family. I love watching sports, specifically Soccer, Football, and Basketball. I recently fell in love with weightlifting.</p>
    
    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p>My goal is to land a good job doing something with technology. As the industry is always expanding with new toys there is almost always something exciting to look forward to.</p>
